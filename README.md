# no-more-flutter-stutter
The No More Flutter Stutter repo is here.
My journey of learning cross-platform, single-code-base technology Flutter. This repo can be seen as a reference sheet for myself and fellow programmers who are on the same track and want to learn more about Flutter and Dart. Concepts about Flutter will be created with self-made examples and demos (if possible).
